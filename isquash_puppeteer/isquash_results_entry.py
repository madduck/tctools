# This is a hack to automate results entry in iSquash, but it'll only work on
# Linux because it effectively simulates key strokes. It is assumed that you
# are using [TournamentControl](https://tournamentcontrol.dtkapiti.co.nz/),
# and that you enter into score into the game comments in the following
# format: "1-11 11-5 11-6 7-11 6-11" if player B won in 5.
#
# For instance, to enter the results for draw M3 round 3, you run:
#
# % sleep 5 && ./isquash_results_entry.py tc2web/export-fixed.xls M33 | xmacroplay :0
#
# and switch to the browser, where the results entry page better be loaded
# with the cursor in the first field, or here be dragons. I mean it, this tool
# will pretend you are typing, so if you have another window active, it will
# receive the keystrokes.
#
# One idea to make this platform-independent is to use
# [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev) to lead the browser interaction.
