# Puppeteering iSquash

If you've ever created a tournament calendar on iSquash, or entered results
for a whole tournament, I am sorry. It's the worst.

Which is why these scripts exist. They do it all for you, except they require
[TournamentControl](https://tournamentcontrol.dtkapiti.co.nz/) to be used,
and configured to export a spreadsheet on save, and they also currently only
work on Linux / X.org, because they are a really ugly hack that basically
pretend to be you typing on the keyboard.

Have a look at the comments at the top of each file for usage info.

The way to make this more accessible is to look into
[Selenium](https://selenium.dev), but that's only on my to-do list at the
moment.
