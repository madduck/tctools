# Poster maker for TournamentControl

This spreadsheet makes it easy to print posters for draws, taking the data
straight out of the spreadsheet exported by
[TournamentControl](https://tournamentcontrol.dtkapiti.co.nz/).

Use the "Basic data" tab to tell it where to find the file that
TournamentControl exports (you need to enable this in the settings), and also
define some other aspects, such as:

* Best-of-3 or -5
* At what points do your players get to play PAR11? If the entire tournament
    is PAR11, enter 0 into both…
* What common notes you want printed on all sheets.

Then, go to one of the draw sheets, enter the draw name (e.g. "m0") into `A1`,
and export the result to PDF to take to the printer, or print right away.
Change the draw name, and the data should update.

This only works for 4 round-robin, 6 type B, and 8 draws for now.
