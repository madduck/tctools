# tc2web on Windows

To allow the data from TournamentControl to make its way to the website at regular intervals, you need to install a couple of prerequisites on the TC computer, and also configure [TournamentControl](https://tournamentcontrol.dtkapiti.co.nz/) to auto-export the data when you've made changes.

## Installing pre-requisites

The following software packages must be installed:

* [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), at least while there is no other way to fix the exported data file;
* [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/) or newer;
* [MiniCap](https://www.donationcoder.com/software/mouser/popular-apps/minicap) for the screenshotting;
* [NcFTP](https://www.ncftp.com/) to handle the uploading.

Once Python is installed, you also need to pull a couple of libraries with the following command run from the command prompt / PowerShell:

```
pip install jinja2 xlrd pytz
```

## Downloading `tctools` to the TC computer

There are two ways in which you can download `tctools` to the TC computer:

1. By [downloading a Zip file](https://github.com/madduck/tctools/archive/refs/heads/main.zip), which you then unpack wherever you want it to live. This is very simple, but if there are updates, you have to download the Zip file again, or else you won't get any improvements and fixes;

2. Using [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win), which allows you to easily update as changes are made upstream.

Downloading Git and installing it might be scary at first, as there are a lot of questions asked. However, you are fine just accepting the defaults for everything. Then, once installed, use the command line / PowerShell and enter:

```
git clone https://github.com/madduck/tctools.git
```

and you will find `tctools` in the subdirectory `tctools`. Easy as.

Finally, to update, change to that directory and run `git pull`:

## Configuring TournamentControl to auto-export

The settings are accessible from the top right of the TournamentControl screen:

Then at the bottom of the settings, you will find the auto-export function:

For file location, please make sure that you have selected the top directory of the   `tctools`, and chosen `tc-export.xls` as the filename.

It is also advisable to configure auto-save in the settings, so that the file is      exported if the machine is left idle, otherwise changes are only propagated if you hit "save" explicitly.

## Running the update loop

The main script `bgupdater.bat` is designed to run in the background and will loop indefinitely, which is fine even if TournamentControl is not running. Therefore, it might be a good idea to start it automatically on the TC computer:

1. Find the `bgupdater.lnk` Shortcut in `tcweb\windows`, select it, and hit `Ctrl-c`;
2. Hit `Windows-R` and type `shell:startup` into the dialog;
3. Hit `Ctrl-v` and the file should appear in the new destination.
4. Reboot and verify that there now a minimised command line window in the task bar:

Now you are ready to roll!
