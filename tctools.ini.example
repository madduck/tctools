# The TournamentControl software uses a combination of draw code and player or
# game number, such as M013 or W1201. Unfortunately, this can be ambiguous: Is
# player M013 #13 in div M0, or #3 in div M00? By default, it's assumed that
# only the first digit is part of the draw, but when running a really big
# tournament with 10+ draws per gender, uncomment the following instead:
#draw_name_pattern = \w\d{2}
#
# Or, if you have 10+ men's draws, but 9 or less women's draws:
#draw_name_pattern = M\d\d|W\d
#
# These are "regular expressions" used to express patterns in strings. \w is a
# "word character", and \d a digit. {2} means two of the previous token, so
# "\d{2}" is the same as "\d\d". The pipe symbol "|" is used to express OR, so
# "M\d\d|W\d" means "either M followed by two digits, or W followed by one.
# See: https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax
