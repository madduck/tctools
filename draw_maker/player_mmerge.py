# Mail-merges the text in the argument with data from the draw maker.
#
# Usage:
#   ./player_mmerge.py draw_maker.ods "Hello {First name} {Squash Code}"
#
# The available field names are exactly the columns names in the
# Men's/Women's Draws tabs in the draw_maker.ods file.
#
# It would be nice if this tool could somehow include a filter to select e.g.
# only the players matching a certain pattern, such as "on the waiting list"
# or "from this club" or "this region".
