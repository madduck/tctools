# SquashNZ Draw Maker

The draw maker is a spreadsheet developed using
[LibreOffice](https://libreoffice.org), which aims to assist in the
pre-tournament phase between collecting registrations on iSquash, and actually
being able to publish your draws. I designed it because I got fed up with
having to deal with changes after I already started colour-coding rows in the
`registrations.xls` file exported from iSquash.

Here are some of the features that might make it interesting to you:

- Simple (albeit manual) import of registrations from iSquash for main event, as well as an (optional) "waiting list" event;

- Data normalisation for players including name and phone number normalisation, both of which are useful for "mail merge" operations;

- Easy interface for assigning players to divisions;

- Method to record playing time restrictions for players, and automatic computation of round 1 & round 2 game days (within limits);

- Tournament time slot planner that allows one to figure out how many people can be hosted, and when games will need to start on any given day;

- Statistics about your players;

- Prize money scratchpad, which auto-calculates the denominations of bills you need to withdraw.

I've recorded a [series of videos](https://vimeo.com/user152357033) to
showcase how to use this tool, and how it facilitates your life.

Looking forward to your feedback.

## Ideas / To-dos:

- Volunteer roster integration;

- A "save-restore" mechanism: provide a view to easily be able to copy-paste player-code-to-draw assignments, such that when a new data set is imported, the previous assignments can be VLOOKUP'd and displayed next to the editable fiels in the draw maker;
